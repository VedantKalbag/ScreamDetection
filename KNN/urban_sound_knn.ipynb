In particular, the sonic analysis of urban environments is the subject of increased interest, partly enabled by multimedia sensor networks, as well as by large quantities of online multimedia content depicting urban scenes.\n\n## Content\nThe dataset is called UrbanSound and contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: Air Conditioner, Car Horn, Children Playing, Dog bark, Drilling, Engine Idling, Gun Shot, Jackhammer, Siren Street, Music. The attributes of data are as follows: ID – Unique ID of sound excerpt Class – type of sound\n\n## Goals\nIn this notebook we will build a model which classifies each sound into one of the unique categories. To do so, we will use the algorithm *k-nearest neighbors* as our model and the [MFFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) as the extracted feature of each audio.","metadata":{"_uuid":"675124666476befe8d9180e60007139bce207a92"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install soundfile","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T13:11:26.444802Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T13:11:26.445188Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T13:11:34.086624Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T13:11:26.445122Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T13:11:34.085096Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport librosa\nimport librosa.display\nimport soundfile as sf # librosa fails when reading files on Kaggle.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport IPython.display as ipd\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T13:04:26.241009Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T13:04:26.241799Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T13:04:26.339944Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T13:04:26.24172Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T13:04:26.338616Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Audio Processing\nFirst, as good data scientists, let's inspect our data by hearing some of those audios files.","metadata":{"_uuid":"90bf2cf86307d0c2ef4c15be7c129de73703c25d"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"audio_path = '../input/train/Train/2.wav'\nipd.Audio(audio_path)","metadata":{"_uuid":"1e9cdd62aabf8764cc9f8dc453faa478054fdf1c","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T13:03:01.314687Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T13:03:01.315437Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thanks to the library we are using for audio processing named *librosa*, we can display the wave plot of our sample.","metadata":{"_uuid":"b020c1d54e9b967b7588c61dd78f52649e73dcce"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract the audio data (x) and the sample rate (sr).\nx, sr = librosa.load(audio_path)\n\n# Plot the sample.\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))\nlibrosa.display.waveplot(x, sr=sr)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_uuid":"28de7b3624619e4d3539e1aa41243aa45c9d1d39","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T13:03:01.316473Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T13:03:01.317231Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/extract-features-of-music-75a3f9bc265d) exceptionally explains, we can extract different features from our audios.
